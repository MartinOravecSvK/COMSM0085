# Unit Organisation

## Timetable

This unit is organised around one large lab held each week in MVB 2.11.
Attendance will be recorded for each of these sessions. There is online material
to support you, which you are expected to watch or read and attempt _before_ the
lab session.

The labs will run on **Fridays, 15:00-18:00**.

During the aforementioned hours you can expect lecturer and TA support, and you
may ask anyone not taking this unit to leave the room if you need a
seat/computer.

There is also a lecture scheduled _11:00-12:00 on Tuesdays_, in _PHYS 1.11_ . 
This is not a mandatory session -- and nothing will appear here that is not 
covered in the lab material -- but it will introduce the week's topics, and
is a place for you to ask questions, or listen to other students' questions
and answers to help you understand the material.


## Online support through Teams

The unit may be running in-person, but **we recommend that you use Teams to ask
questions**. There are multiple benefits to this practice:

1. You can obtain a better thought-out, written answer.
2. Other students who have the same question (they always do) will benefit from seeing the answer.
3. You will be able to refer to your question and the answer when revising (if only to remember how hard it was the first time).

The lecturers and TAs will of course answer questions in-person in the labs
or lectures, but may ask you to repeat your question on Teams. If you do
not wish to do so, they might post it anonymously, along with the answer.


## How to learn in this unit

Learning in this unit is structured around hands-on exercises in the weekly
workshop. To support you in this, you are given access to video lectures that
introduce you to the tools or technologies you'll be working with in each week's
workshop. You are also able to see the workshop exercises ahead of the session
-- this is intentional.  

To make it clear, **you are expected to watch the videos and attempt the exercises
before each workshop.** This takes time, so we recommend that you start early.
Set some time aside during the week _before_ the Friday labs to watch the videos
and preview the exercises, so you can get the most out of the workshops.

Watching the videos will mean you already understand something about the
technologies before the session, while attempting the exercises means you'll
already know where to start and if there is anything you don't understand that
you need to ask about.

Please come to the workshops with questions. It goes without saying that:
* there are no silly questions
* we are here to help you move forward if you've gotten stuck in one part of the
  exercise.

Some activities will involve group work where there is a good reason for it --
for example, to practice working as a team with a git repository.  

If you have not finished the exercises by the end of the workshop, you are
expected to complete them in your own time.

## Assessment

The unit will be assessed via two 1-hour tests that will be delivered during
term time -- these should soon be in your timetable.

The first test will take place in a special session in Week 19, and will cover 
all content from [Part 1](exercises/part1) of the unit (Weeks 13-17).

The second test will take place in the lab slot for Week 24, and will cover 
all content from [Part 2](exercises/part2) of the unit (Weeks 19-23).

Your assessment is based on the _combined_ result of your performance on these
two tests. If you pass on the combined result, you pass, even if you failed one
of the tests. If you fail on the combined result, you fail, even if you passed
one of the tests.

The resit will be a 2-hour paper-based multiple-choice examination taken during
the summer reassessment period, covering _both_ Part 1 and Part 2. It is only
possible to resit the assessment overall, not to resit only one of the tests.


## Schedule

The schedule for [part 1](exercises/part1) of the unit is as follows:

| Week | Exercises          |
|------|--------------------|
| 13   | POSIX Systems      |
| 14   | Git                |
| 15   | Scripting & Build Tools|
| 16   | Debugging          |
| 17   | Databases          | 

(NB Week 13 is the week beginning on Monday 22 January 2024.)

Week 18 is reading week, so there will be no workshops that week.

The schedule for [part 2](exercises/part2) of the unit will be:

| Week | Exercises          |
|------|--------------------|
| 19   | The Web            |
| 20   | Stylesheets        |
| 21   | Javascript         |
| 22   | Webscraping        |
| 23   | Practical Encryption | 

The materials on this website will be updated throughout the course. You can
generally expect that the exercise materials for both the _current_ and _next_
weeks are up-to-date, to support your preparation. Practical exercises for later
sessions may undergo minor alterations, but should remain essentially the same.

This preparation also means the unit should be able to continue to run even if
national strike action or other disruptions affect teaching -- in such a case you
might miss out on some support, but you would still be able to continue working
independently.
